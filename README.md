## Busmall App

I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app 

this app allows the user to select from three images, repeat for a preset number of times, store the user votes, and render a chart that displays user input. This app also uses local storage so the app will elaborate from previous user data
